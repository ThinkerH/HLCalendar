INTRODUCTION

Hello and thanks for checking out JSONKit.

JSONKit was originally part of RipIt, the simplest DVD ripper available for the 
Macintosh, and is now available to the public.

JSON is a simple, text-based data exchange format that's pretty easy for humans
to read.  You can get all of the details here: http://json.org


LEGAL

JSONKit is copyrighted open-source software that is released under the BSD 
License.  For details on the license, see the LICENSE file.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

On Macintosh systems, JSONKit has been extensively tested on Mac OS X version 
10.5 and greater, though there should be no major obstacles to compiling and
running JSONKit on older versions of Mac OS X, or on the iPhone/iPod.
